# online-chat-Java

Fully working online chat written in java (with GUI)

This is the final project for the module of Advanced programming at the University of East London.

This application allows multiple users to chat via text with other users in the network. It uses Threads to allow for multiple connections and also uses a Client-Server infrastructure.

The application is devided in 2 main parts, the Server and the Client.

Server:  To initialize, enter 1 argument:   PORT  i.e.  10007

Client: TO INITIALIZE. ENTER 2 ARGUMENTS:   IP and PORT  i.e.   127.0.0.1  10007


For the application to function, one computer needs to acts as the server and share the ip address with the rest of the users in order to connect. The application also uses the functionality of a data base to store the user names and passwords. We use the open source H2 dabase facilities for this scope. It also uses encryption for safeguard the passwords of the created users.

This was a group project. The group members are: -Edison Mataj -Neil Petiffer -Ernest Asamoah -Andres Herrera -Arlex Arredondo.
